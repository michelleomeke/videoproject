The preloader is seen when the video is still trying to load due to slow network and once the video is done loading, the preloader stays hidden.
You can use the button seen on the bottom-left of the page to either pause or play the video using eventlistener.
Functionalities can be found in the script.js file, the styling in the styles.css file and the structure can be found in the index.html file.
